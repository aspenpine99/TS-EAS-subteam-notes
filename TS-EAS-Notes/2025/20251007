    * There is no request from the TS-EAS co-chairs that you plan to be there!
    * Annual meeting for TS-EAS 2026 will be on-line before the SAA annual meeting

**Submission package**



    * First draft of the submission packet will be sent to the Standards Committee by October 17th. 
    * A copy of the submission package was sent to all TS-EAS team leads for their review, their comments were integrated into the final submission package
    * We took a slightly different approach to the document.
    * Layout and language. We used less technical language in order to make the document easier to understand.
    * Reusing our small working groups result in August 
    * We are using appendices to make the document more concise. Currently the submission package is approximately 20-22 pages.
    * As far as what a submission package should look like,we did maintain the same themes provided by SAA. We just modified the language accordingly.
    * After the submission package has been approved, we can focus on outreach and how we would like TS-EAS to move forward.
    * Tag Library & Schema
    * Other helpful document
    * Final draft of the submission packet will be sent to the SAA Council by the Standards Committee in time for their February 17-19, 2026 meeting.

**Tag Library Examples**



    * Examples in the Tag library used to be provided as snippets. We would like to provide examples with more context which align more closely with the Best Practice Guidelines. 
    * Moving from element-based and attribute-based examples to encoding examples per section within the EAS structure, i.e. &lt;control>, identity section (&lt;identificationData> in EAD), description section (entity and narrative elements in EAD), &lt;relations>
    * These will be included in the Tag Libraries as an annex with references from the individual elements and attributes
    * Aim to have a core version (e.g. only mandatory elements, only essential attributes) and an extended version per example 
    * Aim at using the same examples across all EAS when it comes to shared elements and attributes

**Best Practices Guide Examples**



    * Keeping the approach of providing element and attribute encoding examples in context, illustrating potential alternative encoding approaches as applicable
    * Could be extended by encoding examples provided by the community (which would be marked as such for provenance transparency)

**GitHub: Mark**



    * TS-EAS has created different teams in GitHub
1. EAC-CPF
2. EAC-F
3. EAD
4. Outreach
5. Schema
